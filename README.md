1.	Initially the 2 data sets were given to be used for testing and training. But they were merged since the types of outcomes were different in the training and testing sets.
2.	We have used mutual information gain to check the relevant features, which can be used in model prediction and found that all the features have some relation with the outcome.
3.	The above point is also relevant since we have used SVC and random forest and huge achieve huge accuracy while both training and testing.
